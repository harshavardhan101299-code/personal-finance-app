3. **Add user authentication** for multi-user support
4. **Implement data export** to CSV/Excel formats

## Customization

### Adding New Categories
Edit `src/data/sampleData.ts` to add new expense categories:

```typescript
{
  id: 'new-category',
  name: 'New Category',
  description: 'Description of the category',
  budget: 1000 // Set to null for no budget
}
```

### Modifying the Theme
Update the theme in `src/App.tsx` to change colors and styling:

```typescript
const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#your-color-here',
    },
    // ... other theme options
  },
});
```
