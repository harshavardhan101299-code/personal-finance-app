# Income Tracking Feature

## Overview
I've successfully added a comprehensive income tracking system to your personal finance app. This feature allows you to track your monthly income just like you track your expenses.

## New Features Added

### 1. Income Categories
The income tracking system includes the following predefined categories as requested:
- **Job** - For regular employment income
- **Gradvine** - For income from Gradvine activities
- **Family** - For family-related income
- **Raithu Bandu** - For agricultural/farming related income

### 2. Income Tracker Component
- **New Tab**: Added an "Income" tab in the navigation (between Expenses and Budget)
- **Add Income**: Button to add new income entries
- **Edit/Delete**: Full CRUD operations for income entries
- **Summary**: Shows total income and transaction count
- **Table View**: Displays all income entries with date, category, description, source, and amount

### 3. Data Structure
- Income entries are stored separately from expenses
- Each income entry includes:
  - Date
  - Category (dropdown with the 4 specified categories)
  - Description
  - Received From (source of income)
  - Amount
  - Unique ID

### 4. Integration with Dashboard
- Income data is automatically displayed in the dashboard
- Net savings calculation (Income - Expenses)
- Monthly income tracking
- Charts and visualizations include income data
